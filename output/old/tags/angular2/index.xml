      <description>Introduction Angular framework for building applications. Let&#39;s do a review over its important parts.
Language of choice - Typescript Angular was written in Typescript. As for Dart - Typescript was easily transpiled to Dart and that is how Dart version was maintained. It&#39;s just that Typescript code required some things for Dart version to work. At some point (this summer) - Angular team decided to split Angular Dart project to a separate one for better or worse.</description>

      <description>Offtopic Currently volunteering in organisation called &amp;ldquo;Erasmus student Network Lithuania&amp;rdquo;. Working with a team to develop internal HR system.
Intro Looking at the requirement - there is a need to display data. A list of users. And some actions which can be done with each of the user. Table is a good way to make data look good.
Let&#39;s try to design how could this table look.
Basic requirements  Table might need to display hundreds of records - pagination No need for selecting rows There will be action buttons in each row to interact with user Inline editing Should look nice (we don&#39;t really care about design, just nice is enough) Filtering Sorting  Attempt #1 Using bootstrap - just the markup with some *ngFor magic.</description>
