### Introduction

Not too long ago I started my road to master's in Data world. Currently one of the courses is machine learning. Been learning few algorithms and trying to use them. I thought it will make a good blog post.


#### Disclaimer

I will write in "strong" voice as it is easier to read it, but I am no expert in machine learning, math or scala
