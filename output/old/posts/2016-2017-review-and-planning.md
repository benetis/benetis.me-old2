#### Introduction

2016 was a great year for me - a little bit chaotic too. (If you didn't know - I love chaos). Especially the first half. The important thing - learned a ton and enjoyed the year to the fullest.

#### Review of 2016

##### First half

First half of year I spent with the ESN (organisation I still volunteer in). Kinda miss the experience, but you know what they say - I am happy it happened. I like to remember every single person I got to meet during that time. _Feeling grateful to every single one of them for the experience_. During that time I got to continue to level up leadership, communication skills. Thanks Viktorija and Ieva L. for opportunity. Special thanks goes to my mentor _Mindaugas V._ for teaching on how to reflect and lead.

##### Second half
The other half of the year. Oh yes - that is when software engineering part happened. After a good pause of "real" engineering I though it was going to be harder to catch up. Turned out, few weeks and I was back at the game. After half a year of "pure" engineering I can say I am currently at best shape I ever was. Could have done more, but at the same time I can also say I was pretty lucky at meeting the right people. Analytical, estimations skills were completely missing from my vocabulary. Thanks to my team at work - now I know that I know nothing about them. Will need to learn more about them.

Other achievements - I will say that starting a blog was quite a big one for me.
> I just need to learn to write

That's what pushed me. And still keeping at it! As a side bonus - learning about keeping web in "production".

Starting work on side-project. A little to no progress - but I did start. Will write about it more in the future. From my point of view - also a step in right direction.

Volunteering took quite a part too. Just this time instead of working as a president I was more like team lead. In other words - chairing IT committee for ESN Lithuania. Aside from other committee activities I focused on development and design of internal HR system. Could have done more in this area - but I'll stick around and try to finish what I started.

Real grateful for - my SO, Donata. Who supports me in everything I do. That is my secret for doing things instead of being lazy.

##### Regressions

Focusing so much on engineering, communication, leadership and other skills came with a cost. Health and fitness + learning new things about self-development. Health and fitness levels did go down the most. This is the biggest regression. As for self-dev - while I did keep reflecting on myself - I stopped learning new things.

#### 2017 - Master plan

_Focus on health and fitness_. Priority goal! Hope to achieve even better results than I achieved in 2014 Half 2 / 2015 Half 1. Vessel for brain is important - take care of it!

Other goals?

Instead of exploring new things I am planning to stick to things I started this year. I think I did enough "random" exploring past 7 years. All this exploring will have a clearer goal - become a better frontend engineer. From low level knowledge such as language constructs to high level analysis, communication. I actually expect this point of view have a positive impact on me. Due to prioritising on what is important today and what will be valuable in 10 years.

Side project development - need expertise on how to take pet project to real world.

Keeping up with blog. I think knowing how to write is important - that is my way of learning that.

Catch up with learning about self development. Plan is to make a habit - already failed twice. This time I will I'll start with checking why I need this - make clearer goal.

Backups, security - at some point I want to do a checkup on my infrastructure for backing up and security.

#### Summary

Reflections are in place, a "guide" plan is ready - planning to enjoy every minute of 2017.
