## Contacts and feedback

Feedback is important for everyone. I am no exception. Ping me if something is off. Or you just want to say hi. You can email me at:

Another way to suggest changes to blog content is to open issue here. You can add: paragraphs, comments, fixes, quotes - anything! Community contribution more than welcome. [https://github.com/benetis/benetis.me/issues](https://github.com/benetis/benetis.me/issues)

Thanks in advance!
