##### Intro
Recently I have came across a thing called Elm. It is a functional programming language dedicated to frontend.

##### About language itself
* Functional language
* You will not have to worry about state mutations
* **No runtime errors.** I'll just leave that here
* Friendly and helpful community. Go to slack, try talking - not only you will get your answers - but community will make you feel part of it
* Simplicity. You have this simple architecture emerging from language itself. More about it here - [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)

##### A lot to gain by learning

**Instant new brain power to think in Types while coding** -
_f(x) transforms my x to f(x)_ - while it sounds to simple - this new ability almost instantly made all code produced by me with less side


##### Trying with simple app

It has one purpose - show how old are you with millisecond accuracy. Imagine your age here - quite a kick to stop procrastinating.

While coding - a part where I needed to get current time was more difficult since it involves something that cannot be gained in a pure way. Not enough documentation on this, however Slack community together with SO answers solved the issue.

You can observe how Elm's code looks here - [github](https://github.com/benetis/elm-birthday/blob/master/Main.elm)

##### Summary

* Thinking in types makes development easier
* Coding frontend without runtime errors is relaxing
* Easy to understand architecture keeps things simple

Elm is cool - try it!

### Feedback

If you have any suggestions - I am eagerly waiting for feedback. [https://benetis.me/posts/contact-me/](/posts/contact-me/)
