##### Challenge

Today while reading dev news I came across a 30 days Vanilla JS challenge. Idea is simple - there are 30 "tasks" you need to complete.  The catch? You cannot use any libraries, compilers (lodash, jquery, react, typescript, angular..). In other words - we can only use vanilla js.

In my humble opinion this a great way to practice javascript. We are using tons of libraries, precompilers, postcompilers . This brings us to distance with the language itself.

I'll pick up the glove and complete the challenge_
