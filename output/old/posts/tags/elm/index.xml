      <description>Intro Recently I have came across a thing called Elm. It is a functional programming language dedicated to frontend.
About language itself  Functional language You will not have to worry about state mutations No runtime errors. I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave that here Friendly and helpful community. Go to slack, try talking - not only you will get your answers - but community will make you feel part of it Simplicity. You have this simple architecture emerging from language itself.</description>
