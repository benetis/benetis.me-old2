Chances are that you like classical music. I personally do. There is a beautiful symphony &quot;From the New World&quot; 
 composed by Antonín Dvořák.
 The interesting part is that If you check local classical music events around January the 1st - you will probably see
 this symphony being performed. In my humble opinion, 
 coupled with the music itself, 
 it signals that this piece of art truly carries meaning of new beginning archetype. I am not sure If this is closer to
 rebirth, but it does feel like there is no reason to step back into the old world and we proudly get to celebrate the new one.

 Stepping back into blogging I feel similar. It feels truly feels exciting.
 I can do it and I can do it differently and better (in my opinion).
 The question is what it is better. Previously I wrote blogs to learn to write better and to learn things better.
 Every opportunity at some exercise or presentation I did - I wrote it up. It was beneficial and some posts got quite
 a lot of views (at least in my book). I wrote about things I was learning about - as a tool to learn them better.
 Now my blogging stopped with start of my master studies and a switch from Typescript to Scala in a professional setting. I went to learn about AI field to a specific professor 
 as he looked promising (and indeed the experience lived up to my expectations).
 There were enough projects on my hands and quite many courses and topics to learn. No interest to write blogs as writing, creativity and learning resources
 were spent on university. Fast forward to present: I want to do those things again.
</p><h2>Not a promise</h2><p>
 The question of what is better remains unanswered. In my opinion, If I want to write the best blog posts
 they have to be interesting to me first. In other words - I write to myself.
 Interesting and novelty strongly correlate for me. That is where the majority of future content will be.
 Instead of sharing battle experience on specific topics, I will be journeying somewhere new. 
 I expect that at some time this point of view of mine will change. That being said - I make no promises here.
